## Definition 

f(n) = O(g(n))

means there are positive constants c and k, such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all
n ≥ k.

We say f(n) is *on the order of* g(n), or f(n) is *big O* of g(n).

## Example 

`\[\begin{aligned}
  \dot{x} &amp; = \sigma(y-x) \\
  \dot{y} &amp; = \rho x - y - xz \\
  \dot{z} &amp; = -\beta z + xy
  \end{aligned} \]`
