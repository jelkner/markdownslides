# Big-O

## Definition 

f(n) = O(g(n))

means there are positive constants c and k, such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all
n ≥ k.

We say f(n) is *on the order of* g(n), or f(n) is *big O* of g(n).

## Example 

Show

`\[\begin{aligned}
4n^2 + 42n + 512 = O(n^2)
\end{aligned} \]`

---

From the definition, we need to find values ``k`` and ``c`` such that

`\[\begin{aligned}
0 \leq 4n^2 + 42n + 512 \leq cn^2
\end{aligned} \]`

for all n ≥ k.

---

Let's break ``c`` into three parts, `\[begin c_0, c_1, and c_2 \end \]`
such that `\[begin c = c_0 + c_1 + c_2 \end \]`.
