Some tips for using latex <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text" -->

---

## Which editor to choose?

_Use a proper IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) > [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/)_

<br>

- handling is smoother in an IDE you know
- integration of Git
- better suggestions for citations
- easy integration of plugins (e.g. VIM)

---

## Use Git

- for back up and versioning
  - undo unwanted changes
  - show current changes
  - push your work to Gitlab/Github as backup
- write each sentence in a separate line
  - this helps to better keep track of changes

---

## Adding Structure (1/2)

### `\input{file.tex}`

- is like copying all text from `file.tex` into the current file
- helps to introduce structure

### `\include{file.tex}`

- speed up: changes can be regenerated separately without needing to recompile everything
- can't be nested

---

## Adding Structure (2/2)

- Use `include` for bigger chunks, suchs as chapters and
- use `input` for "deeper" structuring

(see [StackExchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/250))

---

## Other

- Use Glossary
- Use BibTex

---

## Use commands

Why do it?

- Changing a macro is one line and everything else is handled automatically
- much easier than finding the perfect `regex`

Where to use it?

- Definition of frequently used words, variables and formulas
- Definition of own environments, colors, etc

---

## Define your own commands

It is easy to define [own commands](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Commands) in LaTeX:

```latex
\newcommand{\howToCallCommand}{what will be displayed}

% Later in document, just use it
This is \howToCallCommand.
```

Which will result in

```markdown
This is what will be displayed.
```

## To-Do Markers (1/3)

Visual reminders of what remains

- to do
- to check
- to refine
- to think through (new ideas)
- ....

help you to structure your work and to keep track of the open tasks

### To-Do Markers (3/3)

```latex
% Create 'todo' marker (called by \todo{TEXT})
	\newcommand{\margtodo}
		{\marginpar{\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{ToDo}}}{}}
	\newcommand{\todo}[1]
		{\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{(\margtodo{}#1)}}{}}

% Create 'important todo' marker (called by \imp{TEXT})
	\newcommand{\margmajortodo}
	{\marginpar{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{ToDo}}}{}}
	\newcommand{\imp}[1]
	{\textbf{\textcolor{red}{(\margmajortodo{}#1)}}{}}

% Create 'to-check' marker (called by \tocheck{TEXT})
	\newcommand{\margidea}
	{\marginpar{\textbf{\textcolor{green}{Check}}}{}}
	\newcommand{\tocheck}[1]
	{\textbf{\textcolor{green}{(\margidea{}#1)}}{}}

% Create 'idea' marker (called by \idea{TEXT})
	\newcommand{\margtocheck}
	{\marginpar{\textbf{\textcolor{cyan}{Idea}}}{}}
	\newcommand{\idea}[1]
	{\textbf{\textcolor{cyan}{(\margtocheck{}#1)}}{}}
```

## Private Comments (1/3)

Working copy of your thesis is not perfect ! notes help organizing and supplement the ongoing work. Comments that are only visible to you, not your supervisor, allow you to

- Provide more detailed information to some calculations or proofs, e.g. to facilitate proofreading
- Note down additional information that might be incorporated at a later stage
- Add references to further literature regarding the current topic
- Add information that needs to be reviewed
- ...

### Private Comments (3/3)

```latex
% Switch: Hide or show comments
	\newif\ifshowcomments
	\showcommentstrue				% show comments
	%\showcommentsfalse				% hide comments


% Definition of environments
	\definecolor{mygrey}{gray}{0.65}

	% Detailed comments
	\ifshowcomments
		% Display comments in a specified environment
		\newenvironment{bcomment}[1][]
	 	{~\\~\\ \begin{color}{mygrey}\begin{small}\noindent\textbf{COMMENT: #1}~\\}
	 	{\end{small}\end{color}~\\~\\}
	\else
		% Hide comments
		\newenvironment{bcomment}[1][]
	 	{\iffalse #1 \fi}
	 	{}
	\fi
	% Inline-Comments

	\ifshowcomments
		\newcommand{\scomment}[1]{\color{mygrey} [#1]}  % small comments within lines
	\else
		\newcommand{\scomment}[1]{\iffalse #1 \fi}
	\fi
```

## Use TikZ (1/2)

The usage of the LaTeX package TikZ instead of Matlab, MS PowerPoint or MS Visio has the following advantages:

- **Easy to use**: Many templates online and always precise
- **Very flexible**: Changing ranges, legend and the whole look without opening a second program
- **Professional look**: One font (instead of two or three) in the entire document, vectorized graphics

## Miscellaneous

- be sure to use a consistent
  - language (British vs American English)
  - style (image-based vs image based)
- for spacing after abbreviations like `e.g.`, but also after text marcros
  - use `\\` to get a regular space

- I enjoyed reading and was inspired by [Writing Beautifully in LaTeX](https://www.gleave.me/post/latex-design-patterns/) by Adam Gleave - for more details, definitely check it out.
- Noah Snavely posted a very good [style guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zXXtti9JgcTERvIZXNwSRncw2T1dUC8dt6PJlYSH-2g/) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jimantha/status/1232703884113711104) that focuses on papers not thesis
