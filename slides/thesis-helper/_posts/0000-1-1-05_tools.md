## Useful tools

- [Diff PDF](https://vslavik.github.io/diff-pdf/): Great tool for last minute checks, when you don't trust latex anymore and you want to be sure, that only your last changed was made and other formatting stayed the same.
- [CompArXiv](https://pypi.org/project/comparxiv/): Quick and easy comparison of different arXiv versions.
