# Worker Cooperatives and Socialism

---

## The Big Question

* What do we socialists mean when we talk about worker's control of the means
  of production?
* How do we think producers (workers) will exercise their democratic contol over
  the means of social reproduction?
* Answering this question is essentially answering the question, *What does
  socialism look like?*

## Picking Up Where Previous Socialist Projects Left Off

To quote Richard Wolff:

* Traditional socialisms abandoned efforts at democratizing enterprise
  structures and reverted to the employer-employee model of organization.

* Thus a genuinely socialized enterprise as the economic foundation of
  production went missing.

* Promoting and building democratic worker coops is motivated by the need to
  respond to this missing economic foundation.

## What Are Worker Cooperatives?

According to [Democracy at Work Institute](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative), a **worker cooperative** is "a values-driven business that puts
worker and community benefit at the core of its purpose."

### Two central characteristics of worker cooperatives

* workers own the business and participate in its financial success on the
  basis of their labor contribution.
* workers have representation on and vote for the board of directors under the
  one worker, one vote principle.
