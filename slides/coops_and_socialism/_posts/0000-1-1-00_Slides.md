# Worker Cooperatives and Socialism

---

## The Big Question

* What do we socialists mean when we talk about worker's control of the means
  of production?
* How do we think producers (workers) will exercise their democratic contol over
  the means of social reproduction?
* Answering this question is essentially answering the question, *What does
  socialism look like?*

## Picking Up Where Previous Socialist Projects Left Off

To quote Richard Wolff:

* Traditional socialisms abandoned efforts at democratizing enterprise
  structures and reverted to the employer-employee model of organization.

* Thus a genuinely socialized enterprise as the economic foundation of
  production went missing.

* Promoting and building democratic worker coops is motivated by the need to
  respond to this missing economic foundation.

## What Are Worker Cooperatives?

According to [Democracy at Work Institute](https://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative), a **worker cooperative** is "a values-driven business that puts
worker and community benefit at the core of its purpose."

### Two central characteristics of worker cooperatives

* workers own the business and participate in its financial success on the
  basis of their labor contribution.
* workers have representation on and vote for the board of directors under the
  one worker, one vote principle.

## What Are Platform Companies and Why Should You Care About Them?

* *Platform companies* are companies which use *apps* (networked applications)
  to connect consumers to goods and services. 
* Platform companies currently comprise 7 of the 10 largest companies in the
  world as a result in 119 billion dollars in investment in them.
* US platform companies comprise 26% of global total and 5 largest of these
  (Google, Amazon, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft) have a combined market
  capitalization of 2.7 trillion dollars.
* Given their economic power and reach, it should be obvious why we need to
  care about them.

## Platform Cooperatives as a Worker Protecting Alternative

* We live in an increasingly *platform economy* and that is only going to
  become more so, so we must figure out how to deal with it.
* Under current neo-liberal platform economy rules, workers are not employees,
  but independent contractors, who have no protections.
* By making the workers owners, *platform cooperatives* could provide one
  alternative way to protect the rights of workers.
